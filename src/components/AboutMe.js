              I am a Software Engineer located in Maine, USA. As my
              father-in-law likes to say, I am not your "average bear". I bring
              patience, logic, curiosity, and drive to everything I do. I am
              passionate about back-end structure and application functionality.
              I look forward to building applications that will better our
              world.
